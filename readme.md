# KontaktBatteryCheck

Gets the battery level of Kontack.io iBeacons. Really useful to keep an eye on this and send alerts 
when the batteries are almost empty. iBeacons should last about 2 years on a single battery - 
depending on broadcast interval - this seems like just enough time for everyone to forget about
them!

Built using Swift for iOS
